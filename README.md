# Toxi Legal Documents

This directory contains standalone HTML pages for the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service for the Toxi mobile application.

## Files
- `privacy-policy.html` — Privacy Policy  
- `terms-of-service.html` — Terms of Service  

## How to Host on GitHub Pages (new repo `Toxi-Legal`)
1. Create a new GitHub repository named **Toxi-Legal** (public is fine).  
2. Add these files to the repo (root is OK, or place them in `/docs`).  
3. Commit and push.  
4. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**  
   - Source: “Deploy from a branch”  
   - Branch: `main`  
   - Folder: select `/root` (if files are at repo root) or `/docs` if you place them there.  
   - Save.  
5. Wait ~1–2 minutes. Your site will be available at:  
   - `https://<your-username>.github.io/Toxi-Legal/`  
6. URLs to use in App Store Connect:  
   - Privacy Policy: `https://<your-username>.github.io/Toxi-Legal/privacy-policy.html`  
   - Terms of Service: `https://<your-username>.github.io/Toxi-Legal/terms-of-service.html`  

## Optional: Use `/docs` instead of root
If you prefer the GitHub Pages default `/docs` folder:
- Move the HTML files into a `docs/` folder.
- In Pages settings, choose Folder: `/docs`.
- The URLs will be:  
  - `https://<your-username>.github.io/Toxi-Legal/privacy-policy.html` (same path if files remain named the same)
